# Omarchy - Security Research

Turn a fresh Arch installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern security research system based on Hyprland by running a single command. ~~That's the one-line pitch for Omarchy (like it was for Omakub). No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools.~~ Omarchy-Secresearch is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best. **For vulnerability researchers, by vulnerability researchers.**

## TODO

Remove DHH's bloat with more security-friendly and privacy-friendlyg alternatives. For example, switching the default email shortcut (SUPER + E) to open ProtonMail. Install Ghidra and Binary Ninja (demo) by default. Have Zen be the default browser while keeping the omarchy webapp runner. Same general gist, but also more tools for vulnerability researchers installed by default. You'll want to resize your boot partition during archinstall to be able to support all four kernels or however many kernels you're working with during research, and IDA Free will come preinstalled. Feel free to add thoughts in the issues page.
